# Palestinian-Cities-Road-Network-using-Kruskal-s-and-Prim-s-Algorithms
A program that models a road network between Palestinian cities and applies Prim’s and Kruskal’s algorithms to find the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST). It loads city and road data from a file, builds a weighted graph, and compares both algorithms based on total cost and execution time
